# Force Halo Checkpoints
_**You must turn off Easy Anti-Cheat or Anti-Cheat before using this program. You will be banned from these games if you fail to do so. If you are using this in a competive setting, you must disclose so prior to using the program.**_

Features:
- Forces a checkpoint to occur in the campaign of Windows Halo games. This is useful for practicing mission completion strategies.
- Support all games in the MCC, the original Halo CE, Halo Custom Edition, and Halo 2 Vista with and without the Silent Cartograpther mod.
- Can bind a keyboard key and controller button/trigger to force a checkpoint, so you don't have to switch to this program to force a checkpoint.

Notes:

- _**Easy Anti-Cheat (MCC) or Anti-Cheat (H2V with the Silent Cartographer mod) needs to be disabled before using this program. You will be banned from either of these games if you fail to do so. If you are using this in a competive setting, you must disclose so prior to using the program.**_
- Requires .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0. If you don't already have this, you will be told so and prompted to download it.
- Only supports the latest update of MCC.
- Only supports solo gameplay. Does not work in co-op and probably never will unless players sync checkpoints together.
- I have only tested this on 2 computers using Windows 11.
- Should support Windows 8 and newer. If you get XInput 1.4 working on Windows 7, then it may work there too.

To-do:
- Make it work with the Windows Store version of MCC (assuming it doesn't ATM)
- Make sure everything actually works.
- Make things more fool-proof.
- Make more error messages.
- Make icon.
