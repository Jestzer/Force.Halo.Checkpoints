# Halo Force Checkpoints
You must turn off Easy Anti-Cheat or Anti-Cheat before using this program. You will be banned from these games if you fail to do so.

Features:
- Forces a checkpoint to occur in the campaign of Windows Halo games. This is useful for practicing mission completion strategies.
- Support all games in the MCC, the original Halo CE, Halo Custom Edition, and Halo 2 Vista with and without the Silent Cartograpther mod.
- Can bind a keyboard key or controller button/trigger to force a checkpoint, so you don't have to switch to the program to force a checkpoint.

Notes:
- Easy Anti-Cheat (MCC) or Anti-Cheat (H2V with the Silent Cartographer mod) needs to be disabled before using this program. You will be banned from either of these games if you fail to do so.
- Requires .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0. If you don't already have this, you will be told so and prompted to download it.
- Only supports the latest update of MCC.
- I have only tested this on 2 computers in solo gameplay.
- Should support Windows 8 and newer. I have only tested it on Windows 11. If you get XInput 1.4 working on Windows 7, then it may work there too.

To-do:
- Make sure everything actually works.
- Make things more fool-proof.
- Make more error messages.
- Make icon.
