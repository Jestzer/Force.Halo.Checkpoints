# Force Halo Checkpoints
_**You must turn off Easy Anti-Cheat and/or Anti-Cheat before using this program. You will be banned from these games if you fail to do so. If you are using this in a competitive setting, you must disclose so prior to using the program. By using this program, you are entirely responsible for any software, hardware, community, or any other bans you receieve for using this program.**_

Features:
- Forces a checkpoint to occur in the campaign of Windows Halo games. This is useful for practicing mission completion strategies.
- Support all games in the MCC (Steam and Windows Store versions), the original Halo CE for Windows, Halo Custom Edition, and Halo 2 Vista with and without the Silent Cartographer mod.
- Can bind a keyboard key and controller button/trigger to force a checkpoint, so you don't have to switch to this program to force a checkpoint.

Notes:
- _**Easy Anti-Cheat (MCC) and/or Anti-Cheat (H2V with the Silent Cartographer mod) needs to be disabled before using this program. You will be banned from either of these games if you fail to do so. If you are using this in a competitive setting, you must disclose so prior to using the program. By using this program, you are entirely responsible for any software, hardware, community, or any other bans you receieve for using this program.***_
- Requires .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0. If you don't already have this, you will be told so and prompted to download it.
- Only supports the latest update of MCC.
- Only supports solo gameplay. Does not work in co-op and probably never will unless players sync checkpoints together.
- You need to select which game you want to force a checkpoint in. The first 6 games are for the MCC.
- If you have both the Windows Store and Steam versions of the MCC running, then it's only going to use one of them and there is no option to pick between them at the moment (as I suspect nobody will care about this.) Switching between the 2 should be fine.
- I have only tested this on 2 computers using Windows 11, which may mean you will run into some bugs. Please report them!
- Should support Windows 8.1 and newer. If you get XInput 1.4 working on Windows 7 (or this program at all working on it), then it may work there too. Otherwise, if you're on Windows 7, just don't use the controller button binding.
- If you attempt to run this program in Windows 8.1 without the .NET Desktop Runtime 8.0 installed, it may be flagged as a virus.
- Doesn't support Halo Wars nor Halo Spartan Assault/Strike since I don't believe any of those games have checkpoints.
- The Enter and Print Screen buttons cannot be used as hotkeys. I don't intend to add them (except maybe the Enter key, if people really want it.)

To-do:
- Add cheat/ban disclosure for first-time launch.
